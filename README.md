# Cole Swingholm's dotfiles
## I use vim, tmux, and fish for most everything
### I don't use a tmux plugin manager
### For my vim plugins I use vim plug
### for my fish plugins I use fisher
## I also have a startup script to install dependencies, create links for vbox shared folder, and install fonts.
